    <h2>The Rising Global Debt</h2>
    <p>Global debt levels have reached unprecedented heights, with both developed and emerging economies taking on significant amounts of debt. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this trend as governments worldwide implemented stimulus packages to support businesses and workers. International debt has become a critical issue in global economic discussions.</p>

    <h3>The Role of International Institutions</h3>
    <p>International institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank play a central role in managing global debt. These organizations provide financial assistance to countries in crisis, offering loans and grants. They also assist in debt restructuring and help design economic policies aimed at debt reduction.</p>

    <h3>Challenges of High Debt Levels</h3>
    <p>High debt levels pose significant risks to economic stability. For instance, when countries are unable to service their debt, they may face default, leading to severe economic consequences. This could result in higher borrowing costs, reduced public services, and political instability. The burden of debt can also hinder long-term growth by diverting resources away from productive investments.</p>

    <h3>Policy Solutions and Debt Restructuring</h3>
    <p>Countries facing high debt levels must consider various strategies for debt reduction. Debt restructuring, through negotiations with creditors, can provide immediate relief and prevent defaults. Additionally, reforms in fiscal policy, such as reducing budget deficits and increasing revenues, are essential for sustainable debt management.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Debt management remains a critical issue for policymakers. Effective strategies, along with international cooperation, will be key in addressing the challenges posed by the growing global debt crisis.</p>
